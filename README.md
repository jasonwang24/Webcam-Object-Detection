# Webcam-Object-Detection
This python program uses the YOLOv2 algorithm to detect objects from your live webcam.

This program utilizes YOLOv2, tensorflow, and openCV library. The weights I used for the neural network is the YOLOv2 608x608 weight. I recommend using a GPU (I have the NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1050) as it makes processing much quicker.
